# Introduction to Interviewing for Software Engineer Positions at Oddbox

This is a short outline of our hiring process for software engineers at Oddbox. Our goal with this document is to be transparent about the process, set clear expectations, and to remove as much ambiguity as possible.

During the interview process you’ll get a chance to meet a lot of people you’d be potentially working with in the future. We’d like to keep those meetings conversational as much as possible. We will always make sure there is sufficient time in every stage of the process for you to ask questions at the end, but feel free to ask questions at any time.

## Initial call with our talent team
15mins

Quick chat to go over what is Oddbox, our mission, and what makes you want to work here.

The purpose of this call is for us to get a high level overview of each other, get aligned on foundations such as title, compensation, flexible working, perks, and expectations. etc.

## Hiring manager call
30mins

An opportunity to find out more about software engineering at Oddbox. We’ll ask you to talk broadly about your work history and what you’re looking for - and determine if that matches the role we’re looking to hire for.

The purpose of this call is to get aligned about the role, and hopefully for you to get a feeling that Oddbox is the right place for you.

## Technical proficiency test
Up to 4h

A way for you to present your skills without the stress of public presentations. But if you’d prefer to do a pair programming session instead, please let us know. We’re also open to looking at any publicly available projects you have instead if they match our stack and you were a primary contributor there. 

The technical test matches the kinds of problems we work on every day. We promise no gotchas and no technical puzzles! You can take a look at it here but please don’t spend too much time on it, we recommend this test to take no more than 4 hours.

We want to see proof of a level of technical knowledge for the role you’re applying for. We’ll be looking at how you structure your code, how readable it is, etc. - exactly what we do when we do code reviews.

## Technical panel
1h

This panel will consist of 2-3 engineers - your future colleagues. We’ll ask you to go through the technical test/your project. Imagine you’re presenting your work to a colleague who is supposed to take it over from you.
Be prepared to share your screen -  make sure your browser has the right permissions beforehand to save yourself some time during the interview.
We’ll also ask you some general technical questions to gauge your experience in technologies we’re using, and see how you communicate about technical matters. 

Finally, we’ll chat about your previous projects to see what you’ve been exposed to and where your interests lay.

## The ways of working & values panel
1h

This panel will consist of 2-3 non-engineers - usually your future colleagues from our Product and Data teams. 

We’d like to see how you communicate technical matters with someone outside Engineering, how you work with teammates from other fields and what kind of teams you have worked on in the past. 

This is also an excellent time to ask about the way we work at Oddbox if you’d like to learn more about us!

## Final interview
30mins

An opportunity for you to chat with someone from the leadership team at Oddbox. This is meant to be a free form conversation about your motivation, approach to problems, growth possibilities at Oddbox, but most importantly a chance for you to ask someone senior at Oddbox questions to learn more about the company.
